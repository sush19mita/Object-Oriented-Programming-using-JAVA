This repository contains everything OOP using JAVA. I will be updating all my knowledge while learning here.
## What is OOP?
OOP which is Object Oriented Programming is a program paradigm that bundles data(attributes) and methods(functions) to treat them like objects or real world entities and make programs scalable, reusable and maintainable using concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism. It contrasts with older styles by organizing programs around these objects, which interact with each other, rather than just functions and logic.
